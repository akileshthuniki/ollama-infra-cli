# Kubernetes Diagnostics Use Case

## Overview

This CLI tool can significantly enhance Kubernetes troubleshooting workflows by providing AI-powered analysis and explanations directly in the terminal. By integrating local AI models via Ollama, DevOps engineers can quickly diagnose issues without leaving their command-line environment or exposing sensitive cluster data to external services.

## How This Tool Helps with Kubernetes Diagnostics

### 1. **Rapid Log Analysis**
Kubernetes generates massive amounts of logs. Instead of manually parsing through thousands of lines, engineers can pipe logs directly to the AI for instant analysis:

```bash
# Analyze pod logs for errors
kubectl logs my-pod --tail=1000 | python cli.py run --model llama3.1

# Check for specific patterns
kubectl logs deployment/web-app | python cli.py run "Find all ERROR and WARN messages and explain what they mean"

# Analyze events across namespace
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | python cli.py run "Summarize the key issues and their root causes"
```

### 2. **Error Translation**
Kubernetes error messages are often cryptic and technical. The AI can translate these errors into plain English and suggest specific remediation steps:

```bash
# Decode common Kubernetes errors
kubectl describe pod failing-pod | python cli.py run "Explain these error conditions and provide fix suggestions"

# Analyze admission controller errors
kubectl get events --field-selector type=Warning | python cli.py run "What do these admission controller errors mean and how to fix them?"
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Troubleshooting**
The AI can analyze configuration files, resource definitions, and events to provide comprehensive diagnosis of deployment issues:

```bash
# Analyze deployment configuration
kubectl get deployment my-app -o yaml | python cli.py run "Review this deployment config for potential issues"

# Check resource constraints
kubectl top pods | python cli.py run "Analyze resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks"

# Review service configuration
kubectl get svc,ingress -o yaml | python cli.py run "Check for networking issues in this configuration"
```

### 4. **Knowledge Accessibility**
Junior engineers can get expert-level guidance without waiting for senior team members, reducing Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR):

```bash
# Get explanations for complex concepts
kubectl explain pods.spec.containers.resources | python cli.py run "Explain memory and CPU resource management in Kubernetes"

# Understand networking issues
kubectl get networkpolicies -o yaml | python cli.py run "Explain these network policies and their security implications"
```

### 5. **Privacy & Security**
Running Ollama locally means sensitive cluster information never leaves the organization's network, addressing security and compliance requirements.

## Real-World Kubernetes Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pod Startup Issues
```bash
# Get detailed pod information and analyze startup problems
kubectl describe pod my-pod | python cli.py run "This pod is failing to start. What are the main issues and how should I fix them?"
```

### Scenario 2: Resource Exhaustion
```bash
# Analyze cluster resource usage
kubectl top nodes && kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | python cli.py run "Analyze resource usage and suggest optimization strategies"
```

### Scenario 3: Network Connectivity Issues
```bash
# Debug service connectivity
kubectl get svc,ep,ingress -o wide | python cli.py run "Check for networking issues between services"
```

### Scenario 4: Storage Problems
```bash
# Analyze persistent volume issues
kubectl get pv,pvc -o yaml | python cli.py run "Review storage configuration and identify potential issues"
```

## Enhanced CLI Features for Kubernetes

### 1. **Direct kubectl Integration**
```bash
# Add kubectl subcommand for seamless integration
python cli.py kubectl logs my-pod | python cli.py analyze --context "pod-logs"
python cli.py kubectl describe pod my-pod | python cli.py diagnose
```

### 2. **Kubernetes-Specific Models**
```bash
# Use specialized models trained on Kubernetes documentation
python cli.py run "Explain this error" --model kubernetes-expert
python cli.py run "Troubleshoot deployment" --model k8s-troubleshooter
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Analysis**
```bash
# Provide cluster context for better analysis
python cli.py run "Analyze this issue" --context "production-cluster" --namespace "web-app"
```

### 4. **Automated Health Checks**
```bash
# Comprehensive cluster health analysis
python cli.py k8s-health-check --namespace production
python cli.py k8s-security-audit --output security-report.json
```

### 5. **Troubleshooting Workflows**
```bash
# Guided troubleshooting workflows
python cli.py k8s-troubleshoot --workflow "pod-crash-loop"
python cli.py k8s-troubleshoot --workflow "service-connectivity"
python cli.py k8s-troubleshoot --workflow "resource-exhaustion"
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Quick Wins)
- Add `--context k8s` flag for Kubernetes-aware responses
- Create kubectl wrapper commands
- Add common Kubernetes error pattern recognition
- Implement basic YAML/JSON parsing for kubectl output

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Kubernetes-specific model fine-tuning
- Automated health check commands
- Integration with kubectl plugins
- Custom troubleshooting workflows

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features
- Multi-cluster support
- RBAC-aware analysis
- Compliance checking
- Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Example Commands for Common Tasks

### Pod Issues
```bash
# Analyze pod status
kubectl get pods -o wide | python cli.py run "Identify pods with issues and suggest fixes"

# Debug container startup
kubectl logs pod-name --previous | python cli.py run "Why did this container fail to start?"
```

### Service Issues
```bash
# Check service connectivity
kubectl get svc,endpoints | python cli.py run "Verify service endpoints are working correctly"

# Debug ingress problems
kubectl describe ingress my-ingress | python cli.py run "Why is this ingress not routing traffic?"
```

### Resource Management
```bash
# Optimize resource allocation
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | python cli.py run "Suggest resource limit adjustments"

# Check node capacity
kubectl describe nodes | python cli.py run "Analyze node capacity and scheduling issues"
```

### Security Analysis
```bash
# Review RBAC configuration
kubectl get roles,rolebindings,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings | python cli.py run "Audit RBAC configuration for security issues"

# Check network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies -o yaml | python cli.py run "Review network security policies"
```
